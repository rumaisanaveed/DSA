This repository contains the problems related to various data structures. There are some problems which I directly solved at leetcode or geeksforgeeks
and added it to this repository that's why the code will not generate any output because these websites provide some predefined code and we have to write
code only for the function defined to solve the problem. If you want to see the output then, make sure to write the basic code before generating the output.
While some programs are complete and will run without providing any additional code.
